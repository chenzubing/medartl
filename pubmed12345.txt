TI  - Anatomical vs nonanatomical liver resection for solitary hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1833-1846
LID - 10.4251/wjgo.v13.i11.1833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term survival of patients with solitary hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) following anatomical resection (AR) vs non-anatomical resection 
      (NAR) is still controversial. It is necessary to investigate which approach is 
      better for patients with solitary HCC. AIM: To compare perioperative and 
      long-term survival outcomes of AR and NAR for solitary HCC. METHODS: We performed 
      a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and 
      Cochrane Library. Participants of any age and sex, who underwent liver resection, 
      were considered following the following criteria: (1) Studies reporting AR vs NAR 
      liver resection; (2) Studies focused on primary HCC with a solitary tumor; (3) 
      Studies reporting the long-term survival outcomes (> 5 years); and (4) Studies 
      including patients without history of preoperative treatment. The main results 
      were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Perioperative 
      outcomes were also compared. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies, published between 
      2001 and 2020, were included in our meta-analysis, including 9444 patients who 
      were mainly from China, Japan, and Korea. AR was performed on 4260 (44.8%) 
      patients. The synthetic results showed that the 5-year OS [odds ratio (OR): 1.19; 
      P < 0.001] and DFS (OR: 1.26; P < 0.001) were significantly better in the AR 
      group than in the NAR group. AR was associated with longer operating time [mean 
      difference (MD): 47.08; P < 0.001], more blood loss (MD: 169.29; P = 0.001), and 
      wider surgical margin (MD = 1.35; P = 0.04) compared to NAR. There was no obvious 
      difference in blood transfusion ratio (OR: 1.16; P = 0.65) or postoperative 
      complications (OR: 1.24, P = 0.18). CONCLUSION: AR is superior to NAR in terms of 
      long-term outcomes. Thus, AR can be recommended as a reasonable surgical option 
      in patients with solitary HCC.

TI  - [Surgical treatment of primary liver cancer:a report of 10 966 cases].
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112139-20201110-00791 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To summarize the experience of surgical treatment of primary liver 
      cancer. Methods: The clinical data of 10 966 surgically managed cases with 
      primary liver cancer, from January 1986 to December 2019 at Hepatobiliary Center, 
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, were retrospectively 
      analyzed. The life table method was used to calculate the survival rate and 
      postoperative recurrence rate. Log-rank test was used to compare the survival 
      process of different groups, and the Cox regression model was used for 
      multivariate analysis. In addition, 2 884 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) 
      with more detailed follow-up data from 2009 to 2019 were selected for survival 
      analysis. Among 2 549 patients treated with hepatectomy, there were 2 107 males 
      and 442 females, with an age of (56.6±11.1) years (range: 20 to 86 years). Among 
      335 patients treated with liver transplantation, there were 292 males and 43 
      females, with an age of (51.0±9.7) years (range: 21 to 73 years). The outcomes of 
      hepatectomy versus liver transplantation, anatomic versus non-anatomic 
      hepatectomy were compared, respectively. Results: Of the 10 966 patients with 
      primary liver cancer, 10 331 patients underwent hepatectomy and 635 patients 
      underwent liver transplantation. Patients with liver resection were categorized 
      into three groups: 1986－1995(712 cases), 1996－2008(3 988 cases), 2009‒2019(5 631 
      cases). The 5-year overall survival rate was 32.9% in the first group(1986－1995). 
      The 5-year overall survival rate of resected primary liver cancer was 51.7% in 
      the third group(2009-2019), among which the 5-year overal survival rates of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and mixed liver cancer 
      were 57.4%, 26.6% and 50.6%, respectively. Further analysis was performed on 2 
      549 HCC patients with primary hepatectomy. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall 
      survival rates were 88.1%, 71.9%, 60.0%, and 41.0%, respectively, and the 
      perioperative mortality rate was 1.0%. Two hundred and forty-seven HCC patients 
      underwent primary liver transplantation, with 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall 
      survival rates of 84.0%, 64.8%, 61.9%, and 57.6%, respectively. Eighty-eight HCC 
      patients underwent salvage liver transplantation, with the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 
      10-year overall survival rates of 86.8%, 65.2%, 52.5%, and 52.5%, respectively. 
      There was no significant difference in survival rates between the two groups with 
      liver transplantation (P>0.05). Comparing the overall survival rates and 
      recurrence rates of primary hepatectomy (2 549 cases) with primary liver 
      transplantation (247 cases), the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates 
      in patients within Milan criteria treated with hepatectomy and transplantation 
      were 96.3%, 87.1%, 76.9%, 54.7%, and 95.4%, 79.4%, 77.4%, 71.7%, respectively 
      (P=0.754). The 1-, 3-, 5-year recurrence rates were 16.3%, 35.9%, 47.6% and 8.1%, 
      11.7%, 13.9%, respectively(P<0.01). The 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-year overall survival 
      rates in patients with no large vessels invasion beyond the Milan criteria 
      treated with liver resection and transplantation were 87.2%, 65.9%, 53.0%, 33.0% 
      and 87.6%, 71.8%, 71.8%, 69.3%, respectively(P=0.003); the 1-, 3-, 5-year 
      recurrence rate were 39.2%, 57.8%, 69.7% and 29.7%, 36.7%, 36.7%, respectively 
      (P<0.01). The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates in patients with 
      large vessels invasion treated with liver resection and transplantation were 
      62.1%, 36.1%, 22.2%, 15.0% and 62.9%, 31.8%,19.9%, 0, respectively (P=0.387); the 
      1-, 3-, 5-year recurrence rates were 61.5%, 74.7%, 80.8% and 59.7%, 82.9%, 87.2%, 
      respectively(P=0.909). Independent prognostic factors for both overall survival 
      and recurrence-free survival rates of HCC patients treated with liver resection 
      included gender, neoadjuvant therapy, symptoms, AST, intraoperative or 
      postoperative blood transfusion, tumor number, tumor size, cirrhosis, 
      macrovascular invasion, microvascular invasion, and pathological differentiation. 
      Propensity score matching analysis of 443 pairs further showed that there was no 
      significant difference in overall survival rate between anatomical liver 
      resection and non-anatomical liver resection(P=0.895), but the recurrence rate of 
      non-anatomical liver resection was higher than that of anatomical liver 
      resection(P=0.035). Conclusions: In the past decade, the overall survival rate of 
      HCC undergoing surgical treatment is significantly higher than before. For HCC 
      patients with good liver function reservation, surgical resection can be 
      performed first, and salvage liver transplantation can be performed after 
      recurrence. The effect of salvage liver transplantation is comparable to that of 
      primary liver transplantation. As for the choice of liver resection approaches, 
      non-anatomical resection can reserve more liver tissue and can be selected as 
      long as the negative margin is guaranteed.

TI  - Anatomic resection improved the long-term outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      patients with microvascular invasion: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 2190-2202
LID - 10.4251/wjgo.v13.i12.2190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term effect of anatomic resection (AR) is better than that 
      of non-anatomic resection (NAR). At present, there is no study on microvascular 
      invasion (MVI) and liver resection types. AIM: To explore whether AR improves 
      long-term survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by removing 
      the peritumoral MVI. METHODS: A total of 217 patients diagnosed with HCC were 
      enrolled in the study. The surgical margin was routinely measured. According to 
      the stratification of different tumor diameters, patients were divided into the 
      following groups: ≤ 2 cm group, 2-5 cm group, and > 5 cm group. RESULTS: In the 
      2-5 cm diameter group, the overall survival (OS) of MVI positive patients was 
      significantly better than that of MVI negative patients (P = 0.031). For the MVI 
      positive patients, there was a statistically significant difference between AR 
      and NAR (P = 0.027). AR leads to a wider surgical margin than NAR (2.0 ± 2.3 cm 
      vs 0.7 ± 0.5 cm, P < 0.001). In the groups with tumor diameters < 2 cm, both AR 
      and NAR can obtain a wide surgical margin, and the surgical margins of AR are 
      wider than that of NAR (3.5 ± 5.8 cm vs 1.6 ± 0.5 cm, P = 0.048). In the groups 
      with tumor diameters > 5 cm, both AR and NAR fail to obtain wide surgical margin 
      (0.6 ± 1.0 cm vs 0.7 ± 0.4 cm, P = 0.491). CONCLUSION: For patients with a tumor 
      diameter of 2-5 cm, AR can achieve the removal of peritumoral MVI by obtaining a 
      wide incision margin, reduce postoperative recurrence, and improve prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical decision of performing anatomic resection (AR) or 
      nonanatomic resection (NAR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma remains 
      controversial. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on 
      published results to compare surgical outcomes after AR and NAR. METHODS: A 
      comprehensive search of the Pubmed, Ovid-Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, and 
      Science Citation indexes was performed. Overall and disease free survival (DFS), 
      perioperative mortality and morbidity were the main outcomes. The meta-analysis 
      was performed using Revman 5.3 statistical software, and the results are 
      expressed as the relative risk (RR) or weighted mean differences with 95% of 
      confidence intervals. RESULTS: After application of the exclusion and inclusion 
      criteria, 25 studies published between 1996~2015 that compared outcomes after AR 
      and NAR in patients with HCC were identified. A total of 10216 patients were 
      included in the meta-analysis, 4576 in the AR group and 5640 in the NAR group. 
      Liver cirrhosis was found in 54.8% (range from 18.8% to 100%) of patients in the 
      AR group and 67.8% (range from 34.3% to 100%) of patients in the NAR group, 
      resulting in a RR of 0.45 (I2 = 18%, fixed model, 95% CI 0.39-0.52; Z = 10.31; P 
      = <0.00001). The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant 5-year 
      survival (RR of 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17; Z = 2.92, P = 0.004) and DFS (RR: 1.33, 
      95% CI 1.18-1.51; Z = 4.46, P <0.00001) advantage for patients undergoing AR 
      resection compared to NAR. In regards to safety, no statistical significance was 
      found in mortality and morbidity between the two groups. Eight studies including 
      1812 patients with small (<5 cm) solitary HCC indicated a better 5-year DFS in 
      the AR group (41.4%) than in the NAR group (28.6%), with a RR of 1.32 (I2 = 42, 
      fixed model, 95%CI: 1.15-1.52, Z = 3.86, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The current 
      study demonstrates better surgical outcomes after AR than NAR in patients with 
      HCC. Therefore, AR is recommended in resectable HCC, especially with small (<5 
      cm) solitary tumours.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Surgical resection for the treatment of multiple hepatocellular 
      carcinomas (HCCs) is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and 
      oncological outcomes after liver resection in patients with multiple HCCs. 
      METHODS: Clinicopathological and survival data of 187 patients who underwent 
      curative resection for multiple HCCs between June 2004 and December 2016 at Asan 
      Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea were retrospectively reviewed. The prognostic 
      factors for recurrence and survival were identified using univariate and 
      multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients, 153 (81.8%) had two nodules, 
      23 (12.3%) had three nodules, and 11 (5.9%) had more than three nodules. Multiple 
      tumors were located in the ipsilateral lobe in 163 (87.2%) patients. Anatomical 
      resection, non-anatomical resection, and both types of resections were performed 
      in 81.3%, 8.0%, and 10.7% patients, respectively. Recurrence occurred in 133 
      (71.1%) patients, and the mean time to recurrence after surgery was 34.2 months. 
      Independent risk factors for tumor recurrence in multivariate analyses were 
      indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min ≥15%, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein 
      level ≥400 ng/ml, and total tumor diameter ≥6 cm. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year 
      disease-free survival rates were 94.1%, 81.7%, 69.7%, and 39.4%, respectively, 
      and the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 93.5%, 74.2%, 64.9%, and 
      38.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience shows that liver resection can 
      be considered a first-line treatment option for selected patients with multiple 
      HCCs who have well-preserved liver function.

LID - 578763
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is currently the recommended 
      treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver resection 
      (LR) may be an effective option, although recurrences are not uncommon. TACE 
      prior to LR has been proposed as an even better alternative. METHODS: Patients 
      with intermediate-stage HCC who underwent curative resection were enrolled 
      between January 2007 and December 2015. We compared overall survival (OS) and 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the 2 groups using the Kaplan-Meier method, 
      and we determined independent risk factors for death and recurrence using 
      multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 488 patients with HCC at 
      BCLC B (265 patients with LR, 223 patients with TACE+LR) enrolled from our 
      center. Mean follow-up was 40.2 (range, 3.0-128.7) months. For patients receiving 
      TACE+LR and LR, estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 90.6% and 73.3%, 61.7% 
      and 43.5%, and 52.9% and 33.8%, respectively (all P < 0.001) and estimated 1-, 
      2-, and 3-year RFS rates were 54.6% and 39.4%, 41.4% and 29.4%, and 36.3% and 
      26.3%, respectively (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.008, respectively). 
      Significant independent predictors of poor OS were more than 3 (vs. 3 or fewer) 
      tumors (HR=2.19, 95% CI 1.69-2.84), non-anatomical (vs. anatomical) hepatectomy 
      (HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.66), microscopic vascular invasion (HR=1.46, 95% CI 
      1.15-.90), cirrhosis (HR=2.41, 95%CI 1.88-3.01), and intraoperative blood 
      transfusion (HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.66). CONCLUSION: Preoperative TACE with LR 
      may result in better oncological outcomes than either TACE or LR alone, without a 
      substantial increase in morbidity, and could be considered an effective 
      combination treatment for intermediate-stage HCC.

TI  - Prognostic grade for resecting hepatocellular carcinoma: multicentre 
      retrospective study.
PG  - 412-418
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znaa109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is advancing, 
      but a robust prediction model for survival after resection is not available. The 
      aim of this study was to propose a prognostic grading system for resection of 
      HCC. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicentre study of patients who 
      underwent first resection of HCC with curative intent between 2000 and 2007. 
      Patients were divided randomly by a cross-validation method into training and 
      validation sets. Prognostic factors were identified using a Cox proportional 
      hazards model. The predictive model was built by decision-tree analysis to define 
      the resection grades, and subsequently validated. RESULTS: A total of 16 931 
      patients from 795 hospitals were included. In the training set (8465 patients), 
      four surgical grades were classified based on prognosis: grade A1 (1236 patients, 
      14.6 per cent; single tumour 3 cm or smaller and anatomical R0 resection); grade 
      A2 (3614, 42.7 per cent; single tumour larger than 3 cm, or non-anatomical R0 
      resection); grade B (2277, 26.9 per cent; multiple tumours, or vascular invasion, 
      and R0 resection); and grade C (1338, 15.8 per cent; multiple tumours with 
      vascular invasion and R0 resection, or R1 resection). Five-year survival rates 
      were 73.9 per cent (hazard ratio (HR) 1.00), 64.7 per cent (HR 1.51, 95 per cent 
      c.i. 1.29 to 1.78), 50.6 per cent (HR 2.53, 2.15 to 2.98), and 34.8 per cent (HR 
      4.60, 3.90 to 5.42) for grades A1, A2, B, and C respectively. In the validation 
      set (8466 patients), the grades had equivalent reproducibility for both overall 
      and recurrence-free survival (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This grade is used to 
      predict prognosis of patients undergoing resection of HCC.

      Microscope Vascular Invasion: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.
PG  - 3950-3957
LID - 10.7150/jca.32592 [doi]
AB  - Background: The benefits of anatomical resection (AR) and non-anatomical 
      resection (NAR) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with microscope 
      vascular invasion (MVI) remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the prognostic 
      outcomes of AR and NAR for HCC patients with MVI. Study Design: A total of 362 
      consecutive HCC patients diagnosed with MVI after hepatic resection between 
      February 2005 and December 2013 were included in this study. The patient outcomes 
      were compared, and a 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied to 
      eliminate selection bias. Results: Before PSM, compared to the NAR group, the AR 
      group contained more patients that exceeded the Milan criteria, with larger, 
      unilobar tumors and higher AST levels. After PSM, 100 patients were classified 
      into the propensity-matched AR group (PS-AR), while 170 were classified into the 
      propensity-matched NAR group (PS-NAR). Baseline data, including liver function 
      and tumor burden measurements, were similar in the matched groups. The respective 
      1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 78.9%, 56.9%, and 51.5% in the 
      PS-AR group and 76.2%, 53.0%, and 42.4% in the PS-NAR group (P = 0.301). The 1-, 
      3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 51.1%, 44.7% and 42.0% in 
      the PS-AR group and 44.9%, 34.3% and 26.4% in the PS-NAR group, respectively (P = 
      0.039). Multivariate analysis identified AR (P=0.025) as an independent favorable 
      prognostic factor for DFS in HCC patients with MVI. Conclusions: Anatomical 
      resection was superior to non-anatomical resection for improving DFS in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microscope vascular invasion.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the long-term and perioperative outcomes 
      of precise hepatic pedicle dissection in anatomical resection (precise AR) vs 
      non-anatomical resection (NAR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Data 
      from a total of 270 consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy 
      were retrospectively collected. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was 
      performed. The long-term outcomes of precise AR and NAR were analyzed using the 
      Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model.The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
      overall survival (OS) rates were 90.3%, 76.2%, and 65.7% in the PS-precise AR 
      group, respectively (n = 103); and 88.3%, 70.5%, and 52.0% in the PS-NAR group, 
      respectively (n = 103) (P = .043). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free 
      survival (RFS) rates were 83.4%, 63.2%, and 46.0% in the PS-precise AR group, 
      respectively; and 75.7%, 47.4%, and 28.3% in the PS-NAR group, respectively 
      (P = .002). Multivariate analysis showed that ICG-R15, BCLC staging, and 
      microvascular invasion (MVI) were independent risk factors for OS; while tumor 
      size, types of resection, surgical margin, and MVI were independent risk factors 
      for RFS. Subgroup analysis indicated that the RFS rate was significantly better 
      in the PS-precise AR group than in the PS-NAR group for patients with MVI and 
      tumor size ≤5 cm.After PSM, precise hepatic pedicle dissection in AR 
      significantly improved the recurrence-free survival rate of solitary HCC patients 
      compared with NAR, especially in those with MVI and tumor size ≤5 cm.

TI  - Anatomical versus non-anatomical resection for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma 
      without macroscopic vascular invasion: A propensity score matching analysis.
PG  - 870-878
LID - 10.1111/jgh.13603 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The superiority of anatomical resection (AR) in patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma compared with non-anatomical resection (NAR) remains 
      controversial. We aimed to investigate the prognostic outcomes of AR and NAR for 
      solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without macroscopic vascular 
      invasion, using a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. METHODS: A total of 
      305 consecutive HCC patients without macroscopic vascular invasion who underwent 
      curative hepatectomy were included in our study. PSM was performed in order to 
      eliminate possible selection bias. RESULTS: By PSM, the patients were divided 
      into propensity-matched anatomical resection (PS-AR) (n = 114) and 
      propensity-matched non-anatomical resection (PS-NAR) (n = 114) groups. The 
      1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 90.4%, 77.7%, and 65.7% in 
      PS-AR and 88.6%, 70.7%, and 52.2% in PS-NAR (P = 0.053), respectively. The 
      1-year, 3-year, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 84.1%, 
      64.9%, and 45.1% in PS-AR and 75.4%, 48.1%, and 31.0% in PS-NAR (P = 0.005), 
      respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that ICG-R15 (P = 0.022); the 
      Barcelona clinic liver cancer staging (P = 0.044) and microvascular invasion 
      (MVI; P = 0.005) were independent risk factors for the overall survival rate, 
      while type of resection (P = 0.027), surgical margin (P = 0.039), and MVI 
      (P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for the RFS rate. Patients who 
      underwent NAR were prone to early recurrence and marginal recurrence. Subgroup 
      analysis indicated that the RFS rate was significantly better in PS-AR than that 
      in PS-NAR (surgical margin ≥ 1 cm) (P = 0.025). Better RFS rate was observed in 
      PS-AR with MVI compared with PS-NAR (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical 
      resection contributed to improve the RFS rate in solitary HCC patients without 
      macroscopic vascular invasion using PSM analysis, especially in patients with 
      MVI.

TI  - Is It Just a Matter of Surgical Extension to Achieve the Cure of Hepatocarcinoma? 
      A Meta-Analysis of Propensity-Matched and Randomized Studies for Anatomic Versus 
      Parenchyma-Sparing Liver Resection.
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.1007/s11605-019-04494-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefit of anatomic (AR) versus parenchyma-sparing resection 
      (PSR) in hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is still debated. The aim of the study was to 
      compare AR vs. PSR in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival 
      (DFS). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using Medline and Google 
      Scholar. To reduce intra- and inter-study heterogeneity, only propensity-matched 
      studies and randomized clinical trials (RCT) were evaluated and a generic inverse 
      variance meta-analysis was run. A sub-analysis was performed in case of tumor 
      microvascular invasion (MVI). RESULTS: Eleven propensity-matched and one RCT were 
      evaluated, with a total of 3445 patients (AR = 1776 and PSR = 1669). Tumor burden 
      and liver function were comparable among studies (I(2) < 50%, p > 0.5). OS was 
      similar between AR and PSR (HR 0.93; 95%CI, 0.75-1.15; p = 0.50, I(2) = 41%). DFS 
      was improved in AR at 1 year (RR 0.84; 95%CI, 0.72-0.97; p = 0.02; I(2) = 36%) 
      and 3 years (RR 0.90; 95%CI, 0.83-0.98; p = 0.02; I(2) = 40%) but not at 5 years 
      (RR 0.94; 95%CI, 0.87-1.01; p = 0.07; I(2) = 41%). Furthermore, in the presence 
      of MVI, no difference in OS and DFS was observed between AR and PSR. CONCLUSION: 
      When liver function and tumor burden are comparable, AR and PSR achieved similar 
      overall survival. AR improved local control in the early period after surgery. 
      Furthermore, in the presence of MVI, the extension of surgery was not associated 
      with better OS and DFS.

AB  - PURPOSE: For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the superiority of anatomical 
      resection (AR) over non-anatomical resection (NR) is still controversial. In this 
      study, we assessed the potential benefits of AR for HCC. METHODS: We enrolled 173 
      consecutive patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital from 
      August 2003 to May 2013 and compared the outcomes for the AR group (n = 125) with 
      those for the NR group (n = 48). RESULTS: The median observational period was 
      790 days. The 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 92.1 and 85.8 %, 
      respectively; the 1- and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 78.2 and 
      63.0 %, respectively. The AR and NR groups did not significantly differ in the OS 
      or DFS. However, the 2-year DFS was significantly better for the AR group than 
      the NR group among HCV patients (68.2 vs. 32.2 %; P = 0.004) and patients with 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) within the normal range (<20 ng/ml; 76.7 vs. 60.9 %;

      HCV-negative, has low AFP, low total bilirubin, or a tumor diameter of 2-5 cm, AR 
      is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify clinico-pathologic factors that predict 
      survival in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV)-related cirrhosis undergoing liver resection. METHODS: A population-based 
      cohort was investigated to identify cirrhotic patients with confirmed early HCC 
      (tumor size≤5cm and absence of nodal involvement, metastases, or major vascular 
      invasion) after hepatic resection at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital 
      (Shanghai, China) from April 2005 and November 2010 using the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These patients were studied 
      retrospectively in terms of their clinical characteristics and prognostic 
      factors. Predictors for survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and 
      Cox proportional hazards models. Besides, a simple prognostic scoring system was 
      proposed to stratify these patients. RESULTS: Of 537 (2.6% of all HCC patients in 
      this period) cirrhotic patients with early HCC identified who had underwent liver 
      resection, 87% were male. Median tumor size was 2.9cm, and 67% of patients had 
      tumors>2cm. Following hepatic resection, overall median and 5-year survival were 
      75 months and 58%, respectively. Tumor size>2cm (hazard ratio [HR]=1.56), 
      multifocality (HR=1.34), non-anatomic resection (HR=1.44) and vascular invasion 
      (HR=2.03) were associated with worse prognosis (P<0.05). Moreover, these patients 
      could be further stratified into 4 distinct prognostic groups based on the 
      prognostic scoring system developed. CONCLUSION: Tumor size>2cm, multifocality, 
      non-anatomic resection and vascular invasion may be used to stratify HBV-related 
      cirrhotic patients with early HCC after resection. Besides, these data also 
      indicate that pathologic staging is important even in small HCC.

TI  - Parenchymal Sparing Laparoscopic Segmentectomy III and IV with Indocyanine Green 
      Fluorescence Negative Stain Method Using Glisson Pedicle Approach.
PG  - 203-204
LID - 10.1007/s11605-022-05503-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To minimize the loss of functional liver volume in cases of severe 
      cirrhosis and repeat hepatectomy for recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), anatomical hepatectomy is gradually extended from major to minor 
      hepatectomy (Miyama et al. in Cancers (Basel):13, 2021; Ishizawa et al. in Ann 
      Surg 256:959-964, 2012). For local located HCC, (sub)segmentectomy can yet be 
      regarded as a choice instead of hemihepatectomy. Indocyanine green (ICG) has been 
      used for tumor location, navigation of resected margin and liver segment, and 
      identification of bile leakage. Negative stain that ICG dye was administered 
      intravenously after occluding the target portal pedicle is more applicable to 
      sectionectomy or hemihepatectomy, especially in cases where multiple target 
      pedicles exist or portal vein puncture is difficult to carry out to achieve 
      anatomic resection. Herein, we present a video of laparoscopic segmentectomy III 
      and IV with ICG fluorescence negative stain using Glisson Pedicle approach. 
      METHOD: A 49-year-old woman with hepatitis B related cirrhosis for 2 years was 
      referred for treatment of a single nodule in segment IV invading the umbilical 
      portion of left portal vein. The preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 
      442 ng/ml and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 
      was 122 mAu/ml. Liver function was Child-Pugh A and indocyanine green retention 
      test at 15 min (ICG-R15) was 9.2%. The surgical procedure involved the following 
      steps: (1) Extrahepatic Glisson pedicle dissection based on Laennec's s capsule 
      (Sugioka et al. in J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Sci 24:17-23, 2017) was performed for 
      isolation of the pedicles towards segments III and IV in the umbilical fossa. (2) 
      Demarcation line was revealed and ICG (1 ml, 5 mg/l) was administered 
      intravenously for the negative stain after dividing the target pedicles. (3) 
      Parenchyma transection was performed along the border of the negative staining 
      area in the cranial and caudal direction. RESULTS: Operative time was 220 min and 
      blood loss was 150 ml with no transfusion. HCC sized 2.5 cm*1.7 cm*1.2 cm was 
      confirmed in histopathology with a free margin and no microvascular invasion. The 
      fibrosis of the liver parenchyma was S4 based on Ishak system. The patient was 
      discharged on the postoperative day 6 without any complications. No recurrence in 
      residual liver was noted on the CT scan at 9 months during follow-up. CONCLUSION: 
      Laparoscopic segmentectomy III and IV is an effective procedure for HCC 
      especially in cases with demands of hepatic parenchymal preservation. ICG 
      navigation and Glisson Pedicle approach may be particularly helpful.

      the posterosuperior segments of the liver.
PG  - 503-8
LID - S0003469X12018143 [pii]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively our results for 
      laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) including 
      lesions in the posterosuperior segments of the liver in terms of feasibility, 
      outcome, recurrence and survival. MATERIAL OF STUDY: Between June 2005 and May 
      2009, we performed 22 LLR for HCC. The underlying cirrhosis was staged as Child A 
      in 19 cases and Child B in 3. RESULTS: LLR included a non anatomic resection in 
      15 cases and an anatomic resection in 7. A conversion to laparotomy occurred in 
      one (4.5%) patient for hemorrhage. Mortality and morbidity rates were 0% and 
      18.1% (4/20). Over a mean follow-up period of 29 months (range: 19-65 months), 11 
      (50%) patients presented recurrence, mainly at distance from the surgical site. 
      DISCUSSION: A laparoscopic approach is more suitable when the lesion is located 
      in the peripheral "laparoscopic" segments 2 to 6. Nevertheless, six resections 
      were made in the posterosuperior segments. Although parenchymal-sparing resection 
      is required by the presence of underlying liver disease, anatomic resection has 
      always to be considered and pursued to reduce local recurrence. In our series the 
      recurrence rate was similar to those reported for other laparoscopic studies and 
      for open resection of HCC. CONCLUSIONS: LLR for HCC in selected patients is a 
      safe procedure with good short-term results. It can also be proposed in tumor 
      locations with a difficult surgical access maintaining a low morbidity rate and 
      good oncologic adequacy. This approach could have an impact on the therapeutic 
      strategy of HCC complicating cirrhosis as a treatment with curative intent or as 
      a bridge to liver transplantation.

TI  - Anatomical versus nonanatomical resection in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma located in the left lateral segment.
PG  - 1163-70
AB  - To date, no reported studies comparing anatomical resection (AR) and 
      nonanatomical resection (NAR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have restricted 
      cases by tumor location. Thus, right hepatectomy and left lateral sectionectomy 
      are both analyzed together as AR, whereas limited resection of both peripherally 
      and centrally located liver tumors is categorized as NAR. This categorization may 
      result in inaccurate conclusions in the analyses comparing AR and NAR. We 
      conducted a retrospective comparison between AR (n = 30) and NAR (n = 57) for 
      solitary and small (5 cm or less) HCC limited to the left lateral segment (LLS) 
      to clarify whether AR is superior to NAR for HCC in LLS. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
      recurrence-free survival rates were 83.3, 71.3, and 52.9 per cent for the AR 
      group and 82.5, 51.0, and 40.7 per cent for the NAR group, respectively (P = 
      0.10). The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 96.0, 82.8, and 77.9 
      per cent for the AR group and 84.1, 77.0, and 54.2 per cent for the NAR group, 
      respectively (P = 0.07). The postoperative complication, recurrence patterns, and 
      secondary treatment types after recurrence were not significantly different 
      between the two groups. The multivariate analysis including the confounders 
      related to background liver function indicated AR to be a significant protective 
      factor against recurrence, although AR did not influence overall survival. AR was 
      superior to NAR in preventing recurrence without increasing postoperative risks 
      among patients with small solitary HCC limited to the LLS, although AR could not 
      improve overall survival.

TI  - Effect of Surgical Margin Width on Patterns of Recurrence among Patients 
      Undergoing R0 Hepatectomy for T1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An International 
      Multi-Institutional Analysis.
PG  - 1552-1560
LID - 10.1007/s11605-019-04275-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although a positive surgical margin is a known prognostic factor 
      for recurrence, the optimal surgical margin width in the context of an R0 
      resection for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still debated. The 
      aim of the current study was to examine the impact of wide (> 1 cm) versus narrow 
      (< 1 cm) surgical margin status on the incidence and recurrence patterns among 
      patients with T1 HCC undergoing an R0 hepatectomy. METHODS: Between 1998 and 
      2017, patients with T1 HCC who underwent R0 hepatectomy for stage T1 HCC were 
      identified using an international multi-institutional database. Recurrence-free 
      survival (RFS) was estimated, and recurrence patterns were examined based on 
      whether patients had a wide versus narrow resection margins. RESULTS: Among 404 
      patients, median patient age was 66 years (IQR: 58-73). Most patients (n = 326, 
      80.7%) had surgical margin < 1 cm, while 78 (19.3%) patients had a > 1 cm margin. 
      The majority of patients had early recurrences (< 24 months) in both margin width 
      groups (< 1 cm: 70.3% vs > 1 cm: 85.7%, p = 0.141); recurrence site was mostly 
      intrahepatic (< 1 cm: 77% vs > 1 cm: 61.9%, p = 0.169). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
      RFS among patients with margin < 1 cm were 77%, 48.9%, and 35.3% versus 81.7%, 
      65.8%, and 60.7% for patients with margin > 1 cm, respectively (p = 0.02). Among 
      patients undergoing anatomic resection, resection margin did not impact RFS 
      (3-year RFS: < 1 cm: 49.2% vs > 1 cm: 58.9%, p = 0.169), whereas in the 
      non-anatomic resection group, margin width > 1 cm was associated with a better 
      3-year RFS compared to margin < 1 cm (86.7% vs 47.3%, p = 0.017). On 
      multivariable analysis, margin > 1 cm remained protective against recurrence 
      (HR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.28-0.89), whereas Child-Pugh B (HR = 2.13, 95%CI 1.09-4.15), 
      AFP > 20 ng/mL (HR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.18-2.48), and presence of microscopic 
      lymphovascular invasion (HR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.01-2.18) were associated with a 
      higher hazard of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Resection margins > 1 cm predicted 
      better RFS among patients undergoing R0 hepatectomy for T1 HCC, especially small 
      (< 5 cm) HCC. Although resection margin width did not influence outcomes after 
      anatomic resection, wider margins were more important among patients undergoing 
      non-anatomic liver resections.

      after achieving sustained virological response to interferon therapy for chronic

AB  - AIM: Some patients who achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) to 
      interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis C prior to hepatic resection for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience postoperative recurrence. This study 
      investigated the relationship between obesity and postoperative HCC recurrence in 
      SVR patients. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who had achieved SVR before hepatic 
      resection were evaluated. Patients had a solitary tumor ≤5 cm in diameter or ≤3 
      lesions each ≤3 cm in size with no macroscopic vascular invasion (Milan 
      criteria). Patient characteristics potentially associated with recurrence risk 
      were investigated. RESULTS: Three-, 5-, and 7-year recurrence-free survival after 
      surgery were 65%, 44%, and 41%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that 
      obesity (P < .01), hypertension (P = .038), and non-anatomical resection (P = 
      .022) were significantly associated with a lower recurrence-free survival rate. 
      In a multivariate analysis, obesity (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.3-6.1; P < .01) and non-anatomical resection (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI 
      1.1-6.2; P = .025) were independently associated with postoperative recurrence. 
      Three-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates after surgery were 100%, 80%, and 
      64% in obese patients and 100%, 92%, and 82% in non-obese patients, respectively 
      (P = .014). However, other variables showed no significant difference in the 
      overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and non-anatomical resection were 
      independent risk factors for HCC recurrence after hepatic resection and 
      successful IFN therapy. Obesity is an important clinical problem to consider to 
      improve postoperative outcomes in such patients.

TI  - Indications and results of resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 723-8
AB  - AIM: In this retrospective series we evaluate our experience in surgical 
      treatment of HCC and examine early and long-term results of 46 hepatic 
      resections. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with HCC have been observed at our 
      Department. Fifty patients (57%) have been operated, but only 46 (92%) could be 
      resected; 43 patients (93.5%) carried liver cirrhosis. We performed 28 
      non-anatomical resections (60.8%) and 18 anatomical resections (39.2%). Tumour 
      clearance at resection margin of at least 1cm was considered for a curative 
      resections. RESULTS: Overall mortality and morbidity were 8.7 and 30.4% 
      respectively. These rates significantly decreased in the last years: from 1995 to 
      2000 no hospital mortality has been recorded. Hospital mortality among 
      non-anatomical and anatomical resection subgroups was 3.5 and 16.6% respectively 
      (P<0.02). After a median f.u. of 41 months, 19 patients (45.2%) had recurrences: 
      it was intrahepatic in 16 (84.4%). We observed a 3-, 5- and 10-years actuarial 
      survival rate 62, 51.1 and 22.5% respectively. Long term survival significantly 
      differed between non-anatomical and anatomical resections, with 5-year and 
      10-year values of 61.1 and 34.3% vs 37.7 and 18.8% respectively (P=0.0224). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early results after hepatic resection for HCC can be improved by 
      using a limited surgical approach. Long-term results are still unsatisfactory, 
      because of the high recurrence rate that is not influenced by different surgical 
      approaches.

TI  - Robotic hepatectomy: initial experience of a single institution in Singapore.
PG  - 209-14
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2016024 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, we report our initial experience with robotic 
      hepatectomy. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent robotic hepatectomy at 
      Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, from February 2013 to February 2015 were 
      enrolled in this study. The difficulty level of operations was graded using a 
      novel scoring system for laparoscopic hepatectomies. RESULTS: During the two-year 
      period, five consecutive robotic hepatectomies were performed (one left lateral 
      sectionectomy, one non-anatomical segment II/III resection, one anatomical 
      segment V resection with cholecystectomy, one extended right posterior 
      sectionectomy and one non-anatomical segment V/VI resection). Two hepatectomies 
      were performed for suspected hepatocellular carcinoma, two for solitary liver 
      metastases and one for a large symptomatic haemangioma. The median age of the 
      patients was 53 (range 38-66) years and the median tumour size was 2.5 (range 
      2.1-7.3) cm. The median total operation time was 340 (range 155-825) minutes and 
      the median volume of blood loss was 300 (range 50-1,200) mL. There were no open 
      conversions and no mortalities or major morbidities (> Clavien-Dindo Grade II). 
      The difficulty level of the operations was graded as low in one case (Score 2), 
      intermediate in three cases (Score 5, 6 and 6) and high in one case (Score 10). 
      There was one minor morbidity, where the patient experienced Grade A bile 
      leakage, which resolved spontaneously. The median length of postoperative 
      hospital stay was 5 (range 4-7) days. CONCLUSION: Our initial experience 
      confirmed the feasibility and safety of robotic hepatectomy.

TI  - Laparoscopic liver resections for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic 
      patients.
PG  - 236-46
LID - 10.1080/13651820410023941 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic approach for liver resections is still limited and 
      controversial. Nevertheless the advantages connected with a mini-invasive 
      approach are significant, especially in cirrhotic patients. In recent years the 
      progress of laparoscopic procedures and the development of new and dedicated 
      technologies have made endoscopic hepatic surgery feasible and safe. The aim of 
      this study was to report the results of our experience in laparoscopic liver 
      surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: From 
      2000 to 2003, 16 patients (10 male, 6 female; age 48-69 years; mean age 60.1 
      years) with HCC and associated severe but well compensated liver cirrhosis 
      underwent laparoscopic hepatic resections at our department. Mean tumour size was 
      2.9 cm (range 1-3.9). Seven of these lesions were in the left liver and nine in 
      the right lobe. Laparoscopy was performed under CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. The liver 
      was always examined using laparoscopic ultrasound (US) to confirm the extension 
      of the lesions and their relationships to the vasculature. The Pringle manoeuvre 
      was not used. The transection of liver parenchyma was obtained by the use of a 
      harmonic scalpel. The specimens were placed in a plastic bag and removed without 
      contact to the abdominal wall. RESULTS: There was one conversion to laparotomy 
      for inadequate exposure. In the remaining 15 patients we performed 13 
      non-anatomical resections, I segmentectomy and I anatomical left lobectomy. The 
      mean operative time was 152 min (range 80-180). Mean blood loss was 280 ml and 
      none of the patients required blood transfusions. In two patients the resection 
      margin was <1 cm but the capsule was not infiltrated at histology. One patient 
      died on the third postoperative day from a severe respiratory distress syndrome. 
      Major morbidities occurred in two patients who developed moderate postoperative 
      ascites, which resolved successfully with conservative treatment. The mean 
      postoperative hospital stay was 8.8 days. Mean follow-up time has been 18 months, 
      and to date no recurrences at the site of resection or port-site metastases have 
      been observed. DISCUSSION: Limited laparoscopic liver resections in cirrhotic 
      patients are technically feasible with a low complication rate when careful 
      selection criteria are followed (hepatic involvement limited and located in the 
      left or anterior right segments, tumour size smaller than 5 cm, Child-Pugh class 
      A). This approach could be considered the best option for the treatment of small 
      esophitic or subcapsular HCC on well compensated cirrhosis and a useful option 
      when it is necessary to perform a left lateral anatomical resection or 
      non-anatomical resection in well selected patients. In fact the mini-invasive 
      approach can minimise the postoperative morbidity rate, which is still too high 
      in this group of patients. It must be performed in highly specialised units by 
      surgeons assisted by all requested technologies and with extensive experience in 
      hepatobiliary and advanced laparoscopic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The effects of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) prior to 
      hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are controversial. 
      METHODOLOGY: Clinicopathological profiles and prognosis were compared between 
      patients who underwent hepatic resection following preoperative TACE (Group A, 69 
      patients) or only resection (Group B, 158 patients). Univariate and multivariate 
      analyses were used to evaluate whether TACE influenced patient prognosis. 
      RESULTS: Profiles of Group A were comparable with those of Group B except for 
      younger age, higher frequency of major hepatectomy, higher incidence of positive 
      surgical margin, vascular invasion and poorly differentiated HCC. Overall 
      survival was significantly worse in Group A than in Group B (5-year survival 
      rate; 29% vs. 69%; p<0.001). A subset of patients in Group A with complete tumor 
      necrosis by TACE showed comparable survival with Group B. Multivariate analysis 
      revealed that preoperative TACE (hazard ratio (HR)=4.3; 95% confidential interval 
      (CI), 2.8-6.6), non-anatomic resection (HR=1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), blood loss >1L 
      (HR=1.8; 95% CI=1.1-2.8) and vascular invasion (HR=2.3; 95% CI=1.4-3.6) were 
      independent predictors of poor survival. Preoperative TACE was also an 
      independent predictor of extrahepatic metastases (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% 
      CI=1.1-7.1). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative TACE should not be routinely applied for 
      HCC.

AB  - Anatomical resection (AR) is superior to nonanatomical resection (NAR) in theory, 
      but the actual clinical benefit of AR for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is 
      controversial due to the substantial heterogeneity of HCC. Here, we 
      retrospectively compared AR and NAR outcomes for solitary hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) <5 cm in the right posterior section (RPS) and investigated the 
      risk factors for HCC recurrence and liver-related mortality.The study included 99 
      consecutive patients who underwent curative surgical resection of an HCC in the 
      RPS (S6 and S7) between January 2003 and December 2009. Each patient had a 
      solitary HCC <5 cm and a noncirrhotic liver.The median estimated blood loss 
      during operation and median operative time were significantly worse in the AR 
      group. In addition, the median tumor size and incidence of microvascular invasion 
      were significantly worse in the AR group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free 
      survival rates were 74.1%, 66.3%, and 58.2% in the AR group and 84.7%, 64.4%, and 
      48.2% in the NAR group, respectively (P = 0.172). The corresponding liver-related 
      overall survival rates were 96.3%, 84.7%, and 77.0% in the AR group and 97.2%, 
      90.1%, and 88.7% in the NAR group, respectively (P = 0.335). NAR was not 
      associated with HCC recurrence or liver-related mortality in multivariate 
      analysis.The outcomes of NAR for a solitary HCC <5 cm in the RPS are comparable 
      to those achieved with AR with respect to long-term liver-related overall 
      survival and disease-free survival.

AB  - Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of anatomic hepatectomy and 
      non-anatomic hepatectomy in the treatment of single small Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma with MVI. Methods: The clinical data of 84 patients with single small 
      Hepatocellular carcinoma with MVI in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital between January 
      2008 and December 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients undergoing 
      anatomical hepatectomy were enrolled in the AR group, and the patients undergoing 
      non-anatomic hepatectomy were enrolled in the NR group. The efficacy and survival 
      rate of the two groups were compared. Results: (1) Operation time, numbers of 
      patients with volume of intraoperative blood loss ≥300 ml and number of patients 
      with blood transfusion were (170±41)minutes, 8, 7 in the AR group and 
      (148±35)minutes, 19, 18 in the NR group, respectively, with statistically 
      significant differences between the 2 groups (P<0.05). (2) The 1-year, 2-year and 
      3-year overall survival rate were 85.7%, 68.6%, 57.1% in the AR group and 79.6%, 
      53.1%, 42.9% in the NR group, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 3-year 
      progression-free survival rate were 80.0%, 62.9%, 51.4% in the AR group and 
      71.4%, 49.0%, 38.8%, in the NR group, respectively. There were statistically 
      significant differences between the 2 groups both in the overall survival rate 
      and the progression-free survival rate (P<0.05). (3) Prognostic factors analysis 
      of HCC patients with MVI: result of univariate analysis showed that maximum 
      diameter of tumor and surgical procedures were relative factors affecting overall 
      survival and progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, AFP level was 
      relative factors affecting progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, 
      with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). Result of multivariate 
      analysis showed that maximum diameter of tumor between 3.0 and 5.0 cm and 
      non-anatomic liver resection were independent factors affecting poor overall 
      survival and progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, and AFP≥20 μg/L 
      and total bilirubin ≥20 μmol/L were independent factors affecting poor 
      progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, with a statistically 
      significant differences (P< 0.05). Conclusion: Anatomic hepatectomy for patients 
      with single small hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion has better 
      clinical efficacy and safety.

PG  - 231-5
LID - 10.4103/0972-9941.144093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 
      laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation 
      (LRFA) in the treatment of small nodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: We enrolled 50 cirrhotic patients with similar baseline 
      characteristics that underwent LLR (n = 26) or LRFA (n = 24), in both cases with 
      intraoperative ultrasonography. Operative and peri-operative data were 
      retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: LLR included anatomic resection in eight 
      cases and non-anatomic resection in 18. In LRFA patients, a thermoablation of 62 
      nodules was achieved. Between LLR and LRFA groups, a significant difference was 
      found both for median diameters of treated HCC nodules (30 vs. 17.1 mm; P < 
      0.001) and the number of treated nodules/patient (1.29 ± 0.62 vs. 2.65 ± 1.55; P 
      < 0.001). A conversion to laparotomy occurred in two LLR patient (7.7%) for 
      bleeding. No deaths occurred in both groups. Morbidity rates were 26.9% in the 
      LLR group versus 16.6% in the LRFA group (P = 0.501). Hospital stay in the LLR 
      and LRFA group was 8.30 ± 6.52 and 6.52 ± 2.69 days, respectively (P = 0.022). 
      The surgical margin was free of tumour cells in all LLR patients, with a margin 
      <5 mm in only one case. In the LRFA group, a complete response was achieved in 
      90.3% of thermoablated HCC nodules at the 1-month post-treatment computed 
      tomography evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: LLR for small peripheral HCC in patients with 
      chronic liver disease represents a valid alternative to LRFA in terms of patient 
      toleration, surgical outcome of the procedure, and short-term morbidity.

TI  - Laparoscopic liver resection for peripheral hepatocellular carcinoma in patients 
      with chronic liver disease: midterm results and perspectives.
PG  - 499-506
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Report the midterm results of laparoscopic resection for 
      hepatocellular in chronic liver disease (CLD). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical 
      resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic liver disease (CLD) 
      remains controversial because of high morbidity and recurrence rates. 
      Laparoscopic resection of liver tumors has recently been developed and could 
      reduce morbidity. METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, patients with HCC and CLD were 
      considered for laparoscopic liver resection. Inclusion criteria were chronic 
      hepatitis or Child's A cirrhosis, solitary tumor < or =5 cm in size, and location 
      in peripheral segments of the liver. Mortality, morbidity, recurrence rates, and 
      survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included. Liver 
      resections included anatomic resection in 17 cases and non anatomic resection in 
      10. Seven conversions to laparotomy (26%) occurred for moderate hemorrhage in 5 
      cases and technical difficulties in 2 cases. Mortality and morbidity rates were 
      0% and 33%, respectively. Postoperative ascites and encephalopathy occurred in 2 
      patients (7%) who both had undergone conversion to laparotomy. Mean surgical 
      margin was 11 mm (range, 1-47 mm). After a mean follow-up of 2 years (range, 
      1.1-4.7), 8 patients (30%) developed intrahepatic tumor recurrence of which one 
      died. Treatment of recurrence was possible in 4 patients (50%), including 
      orthotopic liver transplantation, right hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation, and 
      chemoembolization in 1 case each. There were no adhesions in the 2 reoperated 
      patients. Overall and disease-free 3-year survival rates were 93% and 64%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that laparoscopic liver resection for 
      HCC in selected patients is a safe procedure with very good midterm results. This 
      approach could have an impact on the therapeutic strategy of HCC complicating CLD 
      as a treatment with curative intent or as a bridge to liver transplantation.

TI  - Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis: analysis of mortality, 
      morbidity and survival--a European single center experience.
PG  - 986-93
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate short- and long-term results of liver resections and prognostic 
      factors in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      single-unit, retrospective study analyzing 216 patients with histologically 
      confirmed cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      All clinico-pathologic and follow-up data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: 
      Child A patients had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate compared to 
      Child B-C: 4.7 vs 21.3% (p=0.0003). Overall morbidity rate was 38.4%; multiple 
      logistic regression analysis identified liver function, hepatic pedicle clamping 
      time, number of nodes and transfusion rate as independent predictors for 
      post-operative complications. Overall and disease-free 5-year survival rates were 
      34.1 and 25.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that Child A, radical resection, 
      tumour size < or =5 cm and, absence of vascular invasion were independent 
      prognostic factors for long-term survival. No significant differences in overall 
      and disease-free survival were found according to the type of resection (anatomic 
      vs non-anatomic). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preserved liver function and 
      small-size, single-node hepatocellular carcinomas are the best candidates for 
      hepatic resection.

TI  - Clinical analysis of anatomical resection for the treatment of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma based on the stratification of liver function.
PG  - 1154-63
LID - 10.1007/s00268-013-2369-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of anatomical resection (AR) 
      for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with that of 
      nonanatomical resection (NAR) based on the stratification of liver function (LF). 
      METHODS: The clinical records of 174 patients with a single HCC, 2-5 cm in 
      diameter and without macroscopic vascular invasion, were analyzed. AR was 
      performed in 132 patients and NAR was performed in 42 patients. The indocyanine 
      green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) of the 78 patients classified as the 
      good-LF group was 10-20 % and the ICGR15 of the 54 patients classified as the 
      poor-LF group was 20-40 %. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and 
      disease-free survival rates of the 174 patients were 67.6 and 33.4 %, 
      respectively. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified ICGR15 ≥ 20 %, liver 
      cirrhosis, α-fetoprotein ≥ 100 mg/dL, and infiltrating growth as independent 
      prognostic factors. Liver cirrhosis was significantly less frequent in patients 
      who underwent AR than in patients who underwent NAR (52 vs. 79 %, p = 0.002). In 
      the subgroup analysis of the good-LF group, there were no significant differences 
      in 5-year OS after AR and NAR (73.3 vs. 65.2 %, p = 0.857). By contrast, in the 
      subgroup analysis of the poor-LF group, the 5-year OS after AR was significantly 
      worse than after NAR (45.3 vs. 77.4 %, p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: In patients with 
      an ICGR15 ≥ 20 %, we recommend NAR rather than AR for the treatment of a solitary 
      2-5-cm-diameter HCC and without macroscopic vascular invasion.

TI  - Systematic extended right posterior sectionectomy: a safe and effective 
      alternative to right hepatectomy.
PG  - 603-11
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31816387d7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A surgical approach based on ultrasound-guided hepatectomy might 
      minimize the need for major resection, whose rates of morbidity and mortality are 
      not negligible. Right hepatectomy (RH) is traditionally performed in cases of 
      vascular invasion of the right hepatic vein with multiple tumors in the right 
      posterior section, and/or of the right posterior portal branch (P6-7) with tumor 
      in contact with right anterior portal branch (P5-8). We herein describe an 
      alternative approach to RH consisting in ultrasound-guided systematic extended 
      right posterior hepatic sectionectomy (SERPS). METHODS: Among 207 consecutive 
      patients who underwent hepatectomies, 21 (10%) underwent SERPS. Median age was 67 
      years (range, 48-79). There were 13 men and 8 women. Ten (48%) patients had 
      hepatocellular carcinoma; 11 (52%) had colorectal liver metastases. Median tumor 
      number was 2 (range, 1-15); median tumor size was 4.5 cm (range, 2.5-20). Ten 
      (48%) patients had cirrhosis, 8 (38%) had steatosis, and 3 (16%) had normal 
      liver. Surgical strategy was based on tumor-vessels relationship at 
      intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) and on findings at color-Doppler IOUS. 
      RESULTS: In-hospital and 90-days mortality were nil. Major and minor morbidity 
      occurred in 3 (14%) and 2 (9.5%) patients, respectively. No patients were 
      reoperated because of complications. Blood transfusions were given to 2 (9.5%) 
      patients. After a median follow-up of 21 months, no local recurrence was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: IOUS-guided SERPS is feasible, safe, and effective. It 
      should be applied whenever possible as alternative resection to RH to maximize 
      liver parenchymal sparing.

TI  - Extent of liver resection influences the outcome in patients with cirrhosis and 
      small hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 311-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term outcome after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is influenced by parameters related to the tumor and the underlying liver 
      disease. However, the extent of the resection, which can be limited or anatomical 
      (including the tumor and its portal territory), is controversial. METHODS: Among 
      64 Child-Pugh A patients with cirrhosis who underwent curative liver resection 
      for small HCC (< or = 4 cm) between 1990 and 1996, 34 patients underwent limited 
      resection with a margin width of at least 1 cm, and 30 patients underwent 
      anatomic resection of at least 1 liver segment with complete removal of the 
      portal area containing the tumor. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of 
      epidemiologic and pathologic parameters. The major end points were: (1) 
      in-hospital mortality and morbidity; (2) overall and disease-free survival; and 
      (3) rate and topography of recurrence. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality (6% vs 7%) 
      and morbidity (52% vs 47%) rates after limited and anatomic liver resection were 
      not statistically different. The 5- and 8-year overall survival rates after 
      limited versus anatomic resection were, respectively, 35% versus 54% (P <.05) and 
      6% versus 45% (P <.05). The 5- and 8-year disease-free survival rates were, 
      respectively, 26% versus 45% and 0% versus 21% (P <.05). Local recurrence was 
      more frequently observed after limited resections than after anatomic resections 
      (50% vs 10%, P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cirrhosis and a small HCC, 
      anatomic resection achieves better disease-free survival than limited resection 
      without increasing the postoperative risk. Therefore, anatomical resection should 
      be the treatment of choice and considered as the reference surgical treatment 
      compared with other treatments.

TI  - Total anatomical laparoscopic liver resection of segment 4 (S4), extended S4, and 
      subsegments S4a and S4b for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 375-9
LID - 10.1089/lap.2014.0443 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When a tumor is located in segment 4 (S4), it is preferable to 
      perform only limited resection of S4, even in laparoscopic surgery. Here we 
      describe anatomical laparoscopic S4, subdivision of S4 (S4a and S4b), and 
      extended S4 segmentectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using the 
      Glissonian pedicle transection method for each, and evaluate the feasibility of 
      laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for tumors located in S4. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Among 417 patients who underwent LLR for malignant tumors between March 
      2003 and February 2014, we performed retrospective analysis of the clinical and 
      perioperative outcomes of 10 patients who underwent anatomical liver resection 
      for tumors located in the S4 area of the liver. RESULTS: Total laparoscopic 
      anatomic liver resection (S4, extended S4, and S4a and S4b segmentectomies) were 
      performed in 10 patients. There was no open conversion or postoperative 
      mortality. The mean operation time was 316.5 minutes (range, 175-460 minutes), 
      and mean estimated blood loss was 592 mL (range, 100-1600 mL). An intraoperative 
      transfusion was necessary in 2 (20%) of the 10 patients. All patients had 
      negative resection margins. Three patients (30%) had postoperative complications 
      (intraabdominal fluid collection). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 
      days (range, 3-13 days). The median follow-up period was 18 months. Intrahepatic 
      recurrence occurred in 2 (20%) of the 10 patients, which was managed by 
      radiofrequency ablation with transarterial chemoembolization in 1 patient and by 
      transarterial chemoembolization alone in the other patient. CONCLUSIONS: Total 
      laparoscopic anatomical S4, extended S4, or S4a or S4b segmentectomy is a 
      feasible procedure for HCC. The Glissonian pedicle transection method is an 
      effective technique for rapid and safe control and subdivision of the S4 pedicle 
      that facilitates anatomical laparoscopic S4, extended S4, and S4a and S4b 
      segmentectomy.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional(3D) visualization 
      technology in the precision diagnosis and treatment for primary liver cancer. 
      Methods: A total of 1 665 patients with primary liver cancer who admitted to 
      seven medical centers in China between January 2009 to January 2019, diagnosed 
      and treated by 3D visualization protocol were analyzed, and their clinical data 
      were retrospectively reviewed. There were 1 255 males(75.4%) and 410 
      females(24.6%), with age of (52.9±11.9) years (range: 18 to 86 years). The 
      acquisition of high-quality CT images with submillimeter spatial resolution were 
      conducted using a quality control system. By means of homogenization methods, 3D 
      reconstruction and 3D visualization analysis were performed. Postoperative 
      observation: pathology reports, microvascular invasion, perioperative 
      complications and follow-up. SPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for 
      statistical description and analysis of clinical data. Kaplan-Meier curve was 
      used to calculate overall survival and disease-free survival rate. Results: (1)In 
      the sample of 1 265 patients, 3D reconstructed models clearly displayed as 
      follows. tumor size: ≤2 cm in 155 cases (9.31%), >2 cm to 5 cm in 551 cases 
      (33.09%), >5 cm to 10 cm in 636 cases (38.20%), >10 cm in 323 cases (19.40%). (2) 
      Classification of hepatic blood vessels. Hepatic artery: type Ⅰ(normal type) in 1

TI  - The Impact of Tumor Size on Long-Term Survival Outcomes After Resection of 
      Solitary Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Single-Institution Experience with 2558 
      Patients.
PG  - 1281-90
LID - 10.1007/s11605-015-2849-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the 7th AJCC TNM staging system, solitary hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) is classified as T1 or T2 based on microvascular invasion (MVI) 
      regardless of tumor size. This study intended to evaluate the prognostic impact 
      of tumor size on survival outcomes after macroscopic curative resection of 
      solitary HCC. METHODS: Patients who underwent R0 resection of solitary HCC <10 cm 
      (n = 2558) were selected for study. Follow-up lasted ≥24 months or until death. 
      RESULTS: HCC was detected during regular health screening or routine follow-up in 
      2054 cases (80.3%). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was associated in 2127 
      (83.2%). Mean patient age was 54.4 ± 9.9 years. Anatomical resection was 
      performed in 1786 (69.8%). MVI was identified in 407 (16.0%) which therefore 
      became stage T2; the other 2150 became stage T1. Tumor recurrence and patient 
      survival rates were 24.9 and 95.0% after 1 year, 49.6 and 84.1% after 3 years, 
      57.7 and 75.0 % after 5 years, and 67.3 and 56.6% after 10 years, respectively. 
      Multivariate analysis showed that non-anatomical resection, MVI, and tumor size 
      >5 cm were independent risk factors for both tumor recurrence and overall patient 
      survival. Long-term survival correlated negatively with tumor size and MVI. 
      Subgroup analysis with MVI and size cutoff of 5 cm revealed a significant 
      survival difference (p = 0.000). Tumor size >5 cm was not a significant 
      prognostic factor in non-HBV patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      the prognostic impact of tumor size may be underestimated in the current version 
      of the AJCC staging system and that solitary HCC staging could be improved with 
      inclusion of tumor size cutoff of 5 cm in HBV-associated patients. Further 
      validation is necessary with multicenter studies.

AB  - A healthy and asymptomatic 55-year-old woman underwent a complete (R0) 
      non-anatomical resection of an incidentally detected solitary hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) in a non-cirrhotic liver. Six years following the initial R0 
      non-anatomical resection, intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed and the patient 
      underwent a second R0 non-anatomical resection. At 12.5 years following the 
      initial resection, a further intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed, which was 
      once again completely resected by left lateral hepatectomy. This represents one 
      of the longest reported periods between initial resection and HCC recurrence, 
      following repeated R0 resections in the absence of cirrhosis. The appropriate 
      surveillance period and genetic testing protocol for such cases remains to be 
      established.

TI  - Hand-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy for solid tumor in the posterior portion 
      of the right lobe: initial experience.
PG  - 674-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prove the feasibility of hand-assisted laparoscopic liver resection 
      for tumors located in the posterior portion of the right hepatic lobe. SUMMARY 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Use of laparoscopic liver resection remains limited due to 
      problems with technique, especially when the tumor is located near the diaphragm, 
      or in the posterior portion of the right lobe. METHODS: Between October 2001 and 
      June 2002, a total of 7 patients with solid hepatic tumors involving the 
      posterior portion of the right lobe of liver underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic 
      hepatectomy with the HandPort system at our hospital. Surgical techniques used 
      included CO2 pneumoperitoneum and the creation of a wound on the right upper 
      quadrant of the abdomen for HandPort placement. The location of tumor and its 
      transection margin were decided by laparoscopic ultrasound. The liver resection 
      was performed using the Ultrashear without portal triad control, with the 
      specimens obtained then placed in a bag and removed directly via the HandPort 
      access. RESULTS: The 5 male and 2 female patients ranged in age from 41 to 76 
      years (mean 62.3 +/- 14.4). Surgical procedures included partial hepatectomy for 
      6 patients and segmentectomy for one, all successfully completed using a variant 
      of the minimally invasive laparoscopic procedure without conversion to open 
      surgery. The mean duration of the operation was 140.7 +/- 42.2 minutes (90-180). 
      The blood loss during surgery was 257.1 +/- 159 mL (250-500), without any 
      requirement for intraoperative or postoperative transfusion. Pathology revealed 
      hemagioma (n = 2), colon cancer metastasis (n = 2), and hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (n = 3). There were no deaths postoperatively, with 1 patient suffering bile 
      leakage. Mean hospital stay was 5.3 +/- 1.3 days postsurgery. CONCLUSION: The 
      results of this study suggest that laparoscopic liver resection using the 
      HandPort system is feasible for selected patients with lesions in the posterior 
      portion of the right hepatic lobe requiring limited resection. Individuals with 
      small tumors may benefit; because a large abdominal incision is not required, the 
      wound-related complication rate might be reduced.

TI  - Changing trends in hepatic resection for malignant liver tumours.
PG  - 292-4
AB  - The records of 57 patients who underwent 65 liver resections for malignant 
      tumours were reviewed. All patients were treated from August 1989 to November 
      1992 at the Hammersmith Hospital. The type of resections performed were: 13 
      extended right hepatectomies, 12 right hepatectomies, 12 left hepatectomies, 1 
      extended left hepatectomy, 7 unisegmentectomies, 10 bisegmentectomies, 3 
      trisegmentectomies and 3 non-anatomical resections. Operative mortality was 1.5% 
      (1 patient). Repeated liver resections for tumour recurrence were performed in 6 
      patients with satisfactory early results. The mean postoperative hospital stay 
      was 19.7 +/- 14.2 days. Improvements in operative results have led to relaxation 
      of resectability criteria. A policy of liver resection for "early" tumours for 
      cure has been extended to "advanced" lesions for symptoms palliation. Liver 
      resection still remains a major operation but has become a routine safe surgical 
      procedure.

TI  - Hepatectomy with microwave tissue coagulation for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 184-91
AB  - From 1984 through 1994, 99 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) underwent hepa-tectomy with microwave tissue coagulation (MTC). We 
      performed limited resection (Hr0) in 28 patients, subsegmentectomy (HrS) in 25 
      patients, segmentectomy (Hr1) in 21 patients, and lobectomy or extended lobectomy 
      (Hr2) in 25 patients. The patients were divided into two groups: group A, 86 
      patients with tumors smaller than 1 kg and no tumor thrombi in the main portal 
      trunk; and group B, 13 patients with a tumor 1 kg or larger, or with macroscopic 
      tumor thrombi in the main portal trunk. In group A, mean blood loss was 838 ml 
      for Hr0, 1948 ml for HrS, 1765 ml for Hr1, and 1325 ml for Hr2. The mean 
      operative time in group A ranged from 3 h 43 min for Hr0 to 4 h 57 min for Hr2. 
      In group B, the mean operative time was 6 h 3 min and mean blood loss was 6053 
      ml. Our MTC method was associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% and a 
      major complication rate of 13.1%. The 5-year survival and disease-free survival 
      rates were 43.4% and 25.4%, respectively. The 5-year survival rate of patients 
      without portal tumor thrombi (50.9%) was significantly better than that of 
      patients with portal tumor thrombi (11.9%) (P < 0.001). The 5-year survival rate 
      of patients who underwent curative resection (58.1%) was significantly better 
      than that of patients who underwent noncurative resection (22.9%) (P < 0.001). 
      The 5-year survival rates of patients in group A without portal tumor thrombi did 
      not differ between those who had cancer-negative margins (54.0%) and those with 
      cancerpositive margins (49.6%) at resection. Recurrence and local recurrence 
      rates did not differ in patients with cancer-positive margins (63.6% and 7.3%, 
      respectively) and patients with cancer-negative margins (56.5% and 8.7%, 
      respectively). These results suggested that microscopic residual cancer in the 
      resected margin was coagulated by MTC. Blood loss, operative time, and clinical 
      outcome in this series of 99 consecutive hepatectomies were comparable with 
      values in earlier reports in which such hemostatic methods as the Pringle 
      maneuver were used. We conclude that hepatectomy with MTC is useful and safe and 
      produces consistent results.

TI  - [Single hepatocellular carcinoma (phi < or = 5 cm) in liver cirrhosis. Early 
      diagnosis and surgical removal].
PG  - 784-8
AB  - 721 patients with liver cirrhosis were regularly screened by sonography and 
      determination of alpha fetoprotein during a period of eleven years 
      (1.1.1982-1.1.1993). In 137 of them hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was diagnosed; 
      28 (20.4%) had a unilocular HCC with a diameter up to 5 cm. Diagnosis was 
      regularly verified by sonographic guided puncture, in rare cases by laparoscopy 
      and biopsy. Beside a diameter of 5 cm the tumor should be localized at least 5 mm 
      from the main structures in the hilus, and not in the centre of the liver; 
      furthermore multilocular hepatocellular carcinomas and intra- and extrahepatic 
      metastases were contraindications. Child-Pugh-classification should be A+B and 
      urea synthesis rate at least 6 g per day. In 21 patients (75%) a portal 
      hypertension was diagnosed; 19 (68%) had bled from esophageal varices; in case of 
      one bleeding a therapeutic sclerotherapy and in case of recurrent variceal 
      hemorrhage an elective shunt operation were performed. Surgical resection was 
      carried out with controlled hypotension and temporary occlusion of the 
      hepatoduodenal ligament. Tumor was removed by segmentectomy or bisegmentectomy 
      and in rare cases by enucleation. There were 3 clinical deaths (10.7%); causes of 
      death were liver failure and (2) sepsis (1). All patients could be followed up to 
      January 1, 1993; there were 12 further deaths of liver failure, tumor recurrence 
      or second tumor. 13 patients are still living. Thus the live expectancy for one 
      year was 80, for 5 years 50 and for 10 years 30%. There is no doubt, that it is 
      possible to detect hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis 
      early by regular sonography and determination of alpha-fetoprotein.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients].
PG  - 770-80
AB  - The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients is 
      increasing. Despite advances in imaging and laboratory screening which allow 
      earlier diagnosis, the surgeon is all too often confronted with an HCC of 
      advanced stage or arising in the setting of severe cirrhosis. Hepatic resection 
      is still considered the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma in 
      patients with liver cirrhosis. From 1998 to 2005, 6 patients (5 males, 1 female, 
      age 52-70 years, mean age 64.1 years) with HCC associated severe, but well 
      compensated liver cirrhosis (Child A-- 4 patients, Child B--2 patients) underwent 
      9 hepatic resection in our department. Mean tumor size was 56 mm (range 23-86 
      mm). Two of these lesions were in the left liver and four in the right lobe. 
      Doppler ultrasonography was performed in all cases and CT in 3 cases to confirm 
      the extension of the lesions. Laparoscopy was performed in 3 patients under CO2 
      pneumoperitoneum. The Pringle maneuver was not used. The transection of the liver 
      parenchyma was obtained by the use of Ligasure and harmonic scalpel. Nine hepatic 
      resections were performed: 7 segmentectomy and 2 non-anatomical resections. The 
      resection margin was 1 cm. The mean operative time was 90 minutes (range 60-120). 
      Mean blood loss was 250 ml and 2 patients required blood transfusion. One patient 
      died on the tenth postoperative day from a severe respiratory distress syndrome 
      and hepatic failure. Major morbidities occurred in three patients who developed 
      moderate postoperative ascites, which resolved successfully with conservative 
      treatment in two patients. Limited liver resection in cirrhotic patients with HCC 
      is feasible with a low complication rate when careful selection criteria are 
      followed (tumor size smaller than 8 cm, Child-Pugh A class and the good general 
      conditions of the patients). Other medical and interventional treatments 
      (chemoembolization, chemotherapy) can only slow the progress of HCC.

TI  - Hepatic lobectomies in children: experience of a center in the light of changing 
      management of malignant liver tumors.
PG  - 228-32
AB  - Hepatic resection is the main treatment modality for hepatic tumors in childhood. 
      Advances in diagnostic technique, preoperative preparation, surgical technique, 
      and postoperative management increased the success rate. The aim of this study is 
      to report our experience in hepatic lobectomy, which is relatively rare procedure 
      in childhood. Medical records of 25 patients who underwent hepatic lobectomy 
      between January 1977 and June 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Age, gender, 
      diagnosis, physical examination findings, results of preoperative laboratory 
      investigations, radiological examination, resectability criteria, preoperative 
      biopsies, chemotherapies, radiotherapies, postoperative pathological results, 
      incisions, operation technique, intraoperative transfusions, drains used, 
      antibiotic prophylaxes, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were 
      evaluated for all patients. Out of 25 patients with hepatic tumor seven patients 
      with hepatoblastoma and four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were given 
      5.7 +/- 0.3 cycles of chemotherapy before the operation. Right lobectomy (n = 
      12), left lobectomy (n = 5), extended left lobectomy (n = 4), and extended right 
      lobectomy (n = 3) and right lobectomy with enucleation of two masses from left 
      lobe (n = 1) were performed. Intraoperative blood transfusion of 30.7+/-6.0 ml/kg 
      body weight was necessary. Pathological examination of resected tumors revealed 
      hepatoblastoma (n=11), mesenchymal hamartoma (n = 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (n 
      = 4), hemangioendothelioma (n=1), malignant mesenchymal tumor (n = 1), hemangioma 
      (n = 1), cyst adenoma (n = 1), and metastasis of cellular mesoblastic nephroma (n 
      = 1). Patients were observed in the intensive care unit for 3.4 +/- 0.3 days. 
      Postoperative complications were sepsis (n = 1), disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation (n = 2), fever (n = 3), jaundice (n = 3), intraabdominal abscess (n = 
      3), ileus (n = 2), and subdiaphragmatic abscess with pleural effusion (n = 1). 
      Hepatic lobectomy is a major operation, which is feasible yielding curative 
      results in children. Safe hepatic resections with acceptable blood loss can be 
      performed by a technique relying on good anatomic dissection and surgical 
      control.

      cases].
PG  - 941-7
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Laparoscopic liver surgery is still in its early stages. The 
      aim of this study was to report our experience in the laparoscopic management of 
      solid and cystic liver tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1991 to December 
      1999, 32 patients with various lesions of the liver underwent laparoscopic liver 
      surgery. One group of patients presented with cysts (n = 15) (11 giant solitary 
      cysts and 4 polycystic liver diseases) and one group of patients presented with 
      solid tumours (n = 18): focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 8), haemangioma (n = 6), 
      adenoma (n = 2), isolated metastasis from a colonic cancer (n = 1) and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1). Fifteen cyst fenestrations and eighteen liver 
      resections were performed via a laparoscopic approach including 1 right 
      lobectomy, 5 left lateral segmentectomies, 2 subsegmentectomies IVb, 1 
      segmentectomy III and 9 non-anatomical resections. RESULTS: Conversion to 
      laparotomy was performed in one case (3%) at the end of the operation (patient 
      who had successfully undergone left lateral segmentectomy for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma) to check the resection margins and surgical transection had been 
      performed in healthy parenchyma. Mean diameter of solid tumours was 6.5 cm and 
      15.7 cm for solitary cysts. The mean operating time for hepatic resections was 
      232 minutes. There was no postoperative mortality. Complications occurred in one 
      case for each group and consisted in intestinal stricture through a port site 
      requiring intestinal resection. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.6 days for 
      solid tumours and 7.5 days for cystic lesions. In the group of cystic lesions, 
      the recurrence rate was 50% with a 5.5-months follow-up. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic 
      liver surgery can be safely performed, but requires a good experience in open 
      hepatic surgery and laparoscopic surgery. The laparoscopic approach is indicated 
      in patients with symptomatic or atypical benign solid tumour, giant solitary cyst 
      and polycystic liver disease, located anteriorly on the liver. Indications for 
      malignant lesions have not been clearly defined and require further information.
